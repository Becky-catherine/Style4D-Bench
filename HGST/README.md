We provide our style transfer module (Holistic Geometry Preserved Style Transfer, HGST), including both the code and pretrained checkpoints.



Due to storage limitations, the VGG weights are hosted via an external download link:

If you encounter issues related to the weight file format, please re-download all weights from the provided link.



## Quick start



We provide scripts for both training (`train_global.sh`) and video/image stylization (`form_style_data.sh`), allowing you to get started quickly.
